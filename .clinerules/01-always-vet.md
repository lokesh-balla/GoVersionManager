Before writing code:
1. Analyze all code files thoroughly
2. Get full context
3. Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution
4. Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion
5. Then implement code
6. Run linting on code using `make vet` and fix any issues
7. Never perform any actions using git
